## R/AA Exam Offers - deciphering the code

```
For those of you that got close but did not pass, you might have been offered an Additional Assessment Examination.

What you will see on Access Adelaide, under your mark in small blue text is this: "Additional Assessment - All Papers" which means that you have been offered an Additional Assessment Examination (and "All Papers" refers to a whole new exam, not part of an exam).

You should study for and sit this exam. You must check the day, time and place via Access Adelaide or the University's Examinations webpage.

If you have been offered a Medical/Compassionate Exam, Access Adelaide will say: "Replacement Examination - All Papers".
```


## Email to RAA

```
This email is to confirm that you have a Replacement/Additional Assessment Examination for MATHS 1012 Mathematics IB.

You will also see a note of this under your result on Access Adelaide.

You should study for and sit this exam.

You must check the day, time and place via Access Adelaide or the University's Examinations webpage.

Best wishes,
Adrian
